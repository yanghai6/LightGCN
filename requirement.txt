All python notebooks are initially designed to run on Google Coalb environment. 

To run the notebooks on Google Colab, make sure to place the holder `LightGCN` containing 
all notebooks and dependency python files into `Colab Notebook` folder on Google Dirve. 
When running the scripts, Google Colab would ask for the permission to visit the files on
your Google Drive. 

To run the notebooks on your device, make sure to change the scripts at the beginning of 
each notebooks and mount it to the correct path.
